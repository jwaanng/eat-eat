# A good diet is key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle, but for many people, taking the time to understanding nutrition and making suitable configurations to their meals is not viable. There are many challenges to overcome such as:
# Lack of expertise: Many people don't have a strong background in nutrition which can make it difficult to know where to start when creating a meal plan. Nutrition is a complex topic that involves understanding not just the basics of macro-nutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) but also the nuances of micro-nutrients, vitamins, and minerals.
# Personalization: Since everyone's body is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another, creating a meal plan that is tailored towards an individuals specific needs is difficult.
# Time-consuming: Researching and creating an effective meal plan can take a lot of time which people may not have the luxury of doing so.
# Eat-Eat will generate a model that takes in basic information of the user, e.g, body weight, height, age, dietary restrictions, physical goals, etc., and create a personalized meal plan for them.
